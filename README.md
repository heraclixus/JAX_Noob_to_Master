# JAX_Noob_to_Master

Learning JAX to Faciliate my own research:

## JAX Fundamentals 

Stuff like: 
- Parallelizing sequential operations (such as loops)
- Autodiff (JVP, VJP, tangent, cotangent, etc.)

## JAX for Dynamical Systems 

Focusing on Diffrax package for modeling:
- ODE, SDE, CDE
- Systems of equations
- PDE
- SPDE 
- Turbulence


## JAX for LLM 

Focusing on using JAX to implement transformer models and LLMs. 


## JAX for Probability Numerics 

Focusing on probability numerical algorithm implementations
